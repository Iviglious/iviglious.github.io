The size of each node depends on number of cores per node. Each core will be a cube of 10px (a constant in the code that can be changed). Between each core there will be space of 18px (a constant) called CORE_SPACE. The height of the node will depend on how many cores can fit per executor (height of executor) + space of 20px (a constant EXECUTOR_HEADER_SPACE) of the top part of the executor as a header for the text and another 20px (a constant) of space on the top part of the node as a header for the text. The excutor will have width of a core + 5px (a constant) for padding in left and right. The height will be the the number of cores + the CORE_SPACE for each core + the EXECUTOR_HEADER_SPACE. Multiple nodes will be stack only vertically (one node per line, one on top of other). Create a function that draws a vCPU 10px by 10px icon and use that function to draw as many vCPUs there are cores per executor inside the executor rectangle.


Amend the executors to be stacked horizontally only and the cores icon to be positioned vertically (one column of cores) with CORE_SPACE between each core and the space between each executor will be calculated such so that CORE_SPACE will be kept horizontally between cores of different executors.

The size of each node depends on number of cores per node. The number of cores per executor determines the height of the node. Draw the cores of a node which are not used by executor (left over cores) with gray color.

Let the nodes to stack horizontally and vertically based on resizing of the browser and don't zoom them in and out upon resizing. Let all nodes be visible.

Node height is determined by the number of executor cores and not number of node cores. Then the width of the node is determined by ceiling of the value of number of cores in node divided by number of cores of executor.
